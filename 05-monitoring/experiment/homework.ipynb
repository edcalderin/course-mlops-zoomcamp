    "## Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this homework is to familiarize users with monitoring for ML batch services, using PostgreSQL database to store metrics and Grafana to visualize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q1. Prepare the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with `baseline_model_nyc_taxi_data.ipynb`. Download the March 2023 Green Taxi data. We will use this data to simulate a production usage of a taxi trip duration prediction service.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the shape of the downloaded data? How many rows are there?\n",
    "\n",
    "* 72044\n",
    "* 78537 \n",
    "* 62495\n",
    "* 54396\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2. Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's expand the number of data quality metrics we’d like to monitor! Please add one metric of your choice and a quantile value for the `\"fare_amount\"` column (`quantile=0.5`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: explore evidently metric `ColumnQuantileMetric` (from `evidently.metrics import ColumnQuantileMetric`) \n",
    "\n",
    "What metric did you choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3. Prefect flow \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s update prefect tasks by giving them nice meaningful names, specifying a number of delays and retries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: use `evidently_metrics_calculation.py` script as a starting point to implement your solution. Check the  prefect docs to check task parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the correct way of doing that?\n",
    "\n",
    "* `@task(retries_num=2, retry_seconds=5, task_name=\"calculate metrics\")`\n",
    "* `@task(retries_num=2, retry_delay_seconds=5, name=\"calculate metrics\")`\n",
    "* `@task(retries=2, retry_seconds=5, task_name=\"calculate metrics\")`\n",
    "* `@task(retries=2, retry_delay_seconds=5, name=\"calculate metrics\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q4. Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start monitoring. Run expanded monitoring for a new batch of data (March 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "What is the maximum value of metric `quantile = 0.5` on th `\"fare_amount\"` column during March 2023 (calculated daily)?\n",
    "\n",
    "* 10\n",
    "* 12.5\n",
    "* 14\n",
    "* 14.8\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q5. Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let’s add panels with new added metrics to the dashboard. After we customize the  dashboard lets save a dashboard config, so that we can access it later. Hint: click on “Save dashboard” to access JSON configuration of the dashboard. This configuration should be saved locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where to place a dashboard config file?\n",
    "\n",
    "* `project_folder` (05-monitoring)\n",
    "* `project_folder/config`  (05-monitoring/config)\n",
    "* `project_folder/dashboards`  (05-monitoring/dashboards)\n",
    "* `project_folder/data`  (05-monitoring/data)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submit the results\n",
    "\n",
    "* Submit your results here: TBA\n",
    "* You can submit your solution multiple times. In this case, only the last submission will be used\n",
    "* If your answer doesn't match options exactly, select the closest one\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deadline\n",
    "\n",
    "The deadline for submitting is 3 July (Monday), 23:00 CEST (Berlin time). \n",
    "\n",
    "After that, the form will be closed."
